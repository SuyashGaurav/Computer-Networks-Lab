# Same_Device_Client_Server
This folder contains Python scripts for a simple video streaming application using sockets in Python. The application consists of two scripts: client.py and server.py, which facilitate video streaming between a client and server running on the same device.

## Concepts Used
- Socket Programming
- TCP/IP Protocol
- Client-Server Architecture
- Packetization: In this application, video frames are packetized using the pickle module before transmission.
- Structuring Data: The struct module is used to pack and unpack binary data into a fixed-size representation.

## How to Run the Code:

Open two terminals on same device.
Navigate to the directory `\Same_Device_Client_Server` in both the terminals.

```bash
cd Same_Device_Client_Server
```

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Start the server in first terminal.

```bash
python server.py
```

Then run client in second terminal.

```bash
python client.py
```

## Output
- Upon running the client and server scripts, you will see two windows pop up: one for the server and one for the client.
- The server window will display the incoming video frames from the client, labeled as "RECEIVING VIDEO."
- The client window will display the video frames being transmitted to the server, labeled as "TRANSMITTING VIDEO."

# Two_Device_OneClient_Server
This folder contains Python scripts for a video streaming application where the client and server run on two different devices.

## How to Run the Code:
Navigate to the directory `\Two_Device_OneClient_Server` in terminal of both devices.

```bash
cd Two_Device_OneClient_Server
```

Run `server.py` on the device intended to act as the server. Make a note of the server's IP address displayed upon running the script.

```bash
python server.py
```

In `client.py`, set the `host_ip` variable to the IP address of the server obtained in step 1.
Then run client on different device.

```bash
python client.py
```

## Output
- Upon running the client and server scripts, two windows will appear in each device: one for the client and one for the server.
- The servers's window will display its own video frames (labeled as "Me") alongside the video frames received from the client (labeled as "RECEIVING VIDEO").
- The client's window will display its own video frames (labeled as "Me") alongside the video frames received from the server (labeled as "RECEIVING VIDEO").
